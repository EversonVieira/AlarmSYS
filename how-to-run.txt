There are 3 folders who we need to use to put this application Online.
We need to have
.Net core 3.1 SDK
Node (Last version)
Sql Server


AlarmSys is our API.

DataBase is where i put the Scripts to put the API - DataBase online,
there's only one script here.

WebApp is our WebApplication made with Angular11, we need to run the powershell/cmd/terminal
on the folder where we have the package.json folder and then put "NPM I" for install the dependencies and then
use NG Serve or Npm Start to Run the application.


CONFIGURATING

We need to setup our database as first step, so, create a DataBaseSchema in some SQL Server instance and then, create an
SQL Login account (You need to use this to use the API with Cross origin), make sure the instance support this.

So, after created the schema and the SQL Account, give the privilegies to this account and run the script stored in /DataBase/script.sql in
the created schema.

After this, go to the AlarmSys application and then find for AppSettings.Json and then change the connectionString giving the parameters of 
your current string.

- Extra config

If you want to put off the white space between the Header/application and the WebBrowser of the WebApplication you need to go to the terminal
and add ng add @angular/material.

And then Type Yes, Yes, Yes. And then you'll have the Application running without this white-space.

I don't know why, but NPM doesn't storage this configuration, so we need to do it to remove this "white space".

If you have any question or doubt just call me. it will be a pleasure to help everyone to run this.
